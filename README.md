  ## Description  
  This application is a Portfolio that was built with React.js and TypeScript. It is a single-page application that showcases my projects, skills, and contact information. The application is responsive and can be viewed on any device.

  The application is divided into four main sections:
  1. About Me: This section contains a brief introduction about me and my background.
  2. Portfolio: This section contains a list of my projects. Each project is displayed as a card with a title, description, and links to the GitHub repository and the deployed application.
  3. Contact: This section contains a form that can be used to send me a message. The form contains fields for the user's name, email address, and message. The form also contains a submit button that sends the message to my email address.
  4. Resume: This section contains a link to my resume. The resume is a PDF file that can be downloaded by clicking the link.
